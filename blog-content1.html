<p> I'm going to show you how to create a weekly routine that will make you into a straight-A Student. I created a routine like this when I was in Years 12 and 13. (You can read more about my own routine in Step 1 of my ebook). It was pared down a bit from this when I was in year 11 (I didn't really start ‘going for it' properly until towards the end of year 11).
</p><p> 
<h3>1. Sleep</h3>
Sleep is fundamental to successful learning and your overall health. When I was at school (and to this day) I consistently try to aim for 8 hours sleep per night. People are different, some need more and some need less. Ideally I'd have at least half an hour more. But, I can function effectively on 8 hours per night.
</p><p>
    So, first take a pen and colour in the hours you're going to be asleep. You're deciding on your bedtime and your wake-up time in doing this.
</p><p>
<h3>2. Self-care time</h3>
Mark in the time at the beginning of the day and at the end of the day that you need for self-care. So, getting up, washing, dressing and the reverse at the end of the day. You might also add in half-an-hour for a cup of tea and a snack when you get home from school.
</p><p>
<h3>3. Meal-times at home</h3>
Mark off the times when your family regularly eats. When I was in the sixth form we ate at 6:30. I always took from 6:30 until 7pm to eat, then I'd go back to the books. You will also want to mark in breakfast time.
</p><p>
<h3>4. School time and travel time</h3>
Block off the hours when you're at school and when you're travelling to and from school.
</p><p>
<h3> 5. Your interests, hobbies and part-time work </h3>
Add in all the things you do outside school work like sports practices, part-time jobs, hobbies you have. Make sure you've marked off the times when these things happen on a regular basis.
</p><p>
<h3>6. Exercise</h3>
Make sure you've allowed some time to move your body on a daily basis. Taking regular exercise helps your brain to work better and keeps you physically and mentally healthy.
</p><p>
<h3>7. Study time</h3>
Now you've marked off all the things you HAVE to do in your week it's time to add in your study time. 
</p><p>
These are the amounts of time I suggest you set aside for study.
</p><p>
Year 11 – 1-1.5 hours per week per subject. If you're doing 10 GCSEs that means you'll be doing 10-15 hours study at home per week.
year 12 – 5 hours per week per subject. If you're doing 4 AS levels that means you'll be doing 20 hours study at home per week.
Year 13 – 6.5 hours per week per subject. If you're doing 3 A2s that means you'll be doing 19.5-20 hours study at home per week.
Your task is to slot this number of hours study into your weekly timetable. If you can't get this number of hours onto your weekly timetable and you want to get the best grades possible then you need to think about what you can give up in terms of interests, hobbies and part-time work. It's an important lesson to learn – you can't do everything! If you consciously decide to do less study time and more of other things then you should understand now that you're making a decision to get lower grades. It's your call.
</p><p>

<h3>8. The time that's left… </h3>
Is there any time left over? Great! That time is yours. Use it as you wish – socialise, read, exercise, play music. Do want feels good to you and recharges you. But, most of all – enjoy!</p>
